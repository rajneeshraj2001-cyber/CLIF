Control Logic Induction Framework
This Framework is used to extract the control logic for any actuator based on sensor values using the Logical Analysis of Data (LAD). We have used SWaT dataset for extracting the rules of actuators. The extracted control logic tells us the rules of operation, we have generated the stealth adversarial samples based on extracted rules. The extracted control logic/rules are mentioned in Control Logic For Each Actuator.py file.
